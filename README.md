# Landing Page Project

## Table of Contents
- started by getting the section elements and storing them to a list.
- then created the li elements through a loop on section list and gave the name on the data of each section to the and stored them to a list called tabs.
- then attached a click event listener to the navbar__list ul element and delegated the clicks to li elements to scroll to the matching section by getting it by its index in the sections list which is mapped to the tabs list.
- wrote the logic to set the active section as the top of the element appears on the screen is marked as active and the others are not active
